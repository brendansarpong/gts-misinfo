Project Prometheus – A Guide to Spotting Digital Misinformation


📚 Lesson Titles + Descriptions
1. What Is Misinformation, Really?
Good question! Not all wrong stuff online is a lie on purpose. This lesson breaks down the difference between misinformation, disinformation, and just plain confusion.
2. The Algorithm Doesn’t Love You
Your feed isn’t neutral. It’s designed to keep you scrolling, not to keep you informed. We’ll look at how platforms decide what you see and why that matters.
3. Follow the Money
It’s all about the Benjamins baby. Everyone’s got a hustle, and media is no different. Learn how financial incentives shape what gets published and what doesn’t.

Just because it looks like a tweet doesn’t mean it’s real. We'll break down how easy it is to fake screenshots and what to do instead of just hitting “share.”

If everyone you follow agrees with you, that’s not a coincidence. This lesson unpacks how people (and platforms) create filter bubbles (and how to pop them)
6. Fear is the Mind Killer
Outrage, fear, awe: these are buttons misinformation loves to press. We’ll teach you how to notice when you're being manipulated and pause before reacting.
7. Fact-Checking Isn’t Just for Nerds
Knowing how to double-check things is power. We’ll walk through real, simple tools that can help you tell what’s real without needing a PhD.
8. Go Ahead and Log Off for Me
Sometimes the smartest move is to step away. Learn when it’s worth your time to engage and when to let the noise go. Stop getting ragebaited!

🧠 LESSON 2: The Algorithm Doesn’t Love You
🔹 Slide 1: Algorithms Are Not Your Friend
            * Social media sites make money from your attention

            * They show you content you’re most likely to click, not what’s most accurate

            * That’s why you’ll see drama and controversy before facts

🔹 Slide 2: The Feedback Loop
               * You like one conspiracy video → you get more

               * Your feed isn’t reality—it’s a reflection of what the app thinks you like

               * It’s easy to end up in a loop of extreme or false content

🔹 Slide 3: Take Back Control
                  * Turn off autoplay

                  * Follow people who challenge your views

                  * Use search engines, not just feeds, to find info

🧠 LESSON 3: Follow the Money
🔹 Slide 1: The Media Has Bills Too
                     * News sites make money from ads, subscriptions, or products

                     * That means their content can be shaped by what gets clicks or sells

🔹 Slide 2: Real Examples
                        * The Daily Wire pushes outrage because it sells memberships

                        * Steven Crowder jokes while selling merch (those mugs aren’t free)

                        * The Washington Post? Owned by Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon

🔹 Slide 3: What to Look For
                           * Who owns the site?

                           * What’s being sold—ads, products, an idea?

🧠 LESSON 4: That’s Cap (Screenshots Lie)
🔹 Slide 1: Screenshots, Deepfakes, and AI—Oh My
                              * Anyone can fake a screenshot using free tools. It’s super easy.

                              * But now we’ve also got AI-generated images and deepfake videos that can show people saying or doing things they never did.

                              * It looks real. It spreads fast. It’s often fake.

Example: A fake image of the Pope in a designer puffer coat went viral before people realized it was made with AI. Same with fake videos of celebrities or politicians saying things they never said.
🔹 Slide 2: Spot the Fakes
                                 * Screenshots: Blurry? Weird font? No link to the real post? Red flags.

                                 * AI images: Look for messed up hands, too-perfect faces, weird backgrounds, or text that looks like gibberish.

                                 * Videos: If a video seems off, check the source—deepfakes often spread without context or come from shady accounts.

Tip: Reverse image search. Tools like Google Lens or InVID (for videos) can help check where a file came from.
🔹 Slide 3: What You Can Do
                                    * Don’t trust a post just because it has a picture or video.

                                    * Always look for a real source—can you find it on a trusted site, or is it only showing up on Twitter/X or TikTok?

                                    * If something feels too perfect or wild to be true, stop and ask: Who made this, and why?
