          <h2>Screenshots, Deepfakes, and AI—Oh My</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Anyone can fake a screenshot using free tools. It's super easy.</li>
            <li>But now we've also got AI-generated images and deepfake videos that can show people saying or doing things they never did.</li>
            <li>It looks real. It spreads fast. It's often fake.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Example:</b> A fake image of the Pope in a designer puffer coat went viral before people realized it was made with AI. Same with fake videos of celebrities or politicians saying things they never said.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>Spot the Fakes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Screenshots: Blurry? Weird font? No link to the real post? Red flags.</li>
            <li>AI images: Look for messed up hands, too-perfect faces, weird backgrounds, or text that looks like gibberish.</li>
            <li>Videos: If a video seems off, check the source—deepfakes often spread without context or come from shady accounts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Tip:</b> Reverse image search. Tools like Google Lens or InVID (for videos) can help check where a file came from.</p>
          <hr>
          <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't trust a post just because it has a picture or video.</li>
            <li>Always look for a real source—can you find it on a trusted site, or is it only showing up on Twitter/X or TikTok?</li>
            <li>If something feels too perfect or wild to be true, stop and ask: Who made this, and why?</li>
